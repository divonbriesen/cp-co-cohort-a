# JS Exercise 1
This exercise covers conditionals and variables

## Usage
* Check out the `main` branch for an annotated solution. 
* Check out the `bare-bones` branch for a bare bones solution.
* Copy and paste each requirement into the browser console. Make sure to refresh so that you don't get variable re-assignment errors!

## Exercise Instructions
Your client (Catalyte) has requested a series of statements needed to complete sections of a JavaScript library. They have specified the variables available and the results they wish to see. Your task is to add in the lines of code needed to complete those requirements. Use your IDE to complete these exercises. 

## Requirements
1. Given two variables, `x` and `y`, swap their values so that `x` is less than `y`.
2. Given three variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, where `x` and `y` are both positive numbers. Set `z` to be a string of each value from 0 to `y` that is divisible by `x`.
3. Given two variables, `x` and `y`, perform the following based on the value of `x`:
  1. `x = 'A'`: Set `y` to the value of `x`. 
  2. `x = 'B'`: Set `y` to 3 times the value of `y`.
  3. `x = 'C'`: Set `y` to be 0.
  4. `x = 'D'`: Set `y` to null

## Stretch Requirements
1. Given four variables, `x`, `y`, `even`, and `odd`, where `x` and `y` are positive numbers and `even` and `odd` start at 0; count how many numbers are even or odd between `x` and `y`.
