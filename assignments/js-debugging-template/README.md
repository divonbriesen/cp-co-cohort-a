# JS Debugging Exercise
An elementary school hired you to build a word search generator for them. You built one that met the following requirements:
* User can specify the width and height of the grid
* User can add words to a word bank if they meet the following conditions:
    * Word is at least 3 characters long
    * Word includes only English letters
    * Word is unique
* User can remove individual words from the word bank by clicking the trash can icon for that word
* When user clicks "Create", a grid is generated
    * Grid has random letters
    * Grid has the width and height that were specified
    * Grid places all words from word bank or informs user that it couldn't

Unfortunately, someone edited the code and broke the generator. The school has asked us to give them a working copy again, but we already deleted the original. The school gave us the currently broken code. It's your job to find and correct the errors. The school would also like a record of all the changes that were made. You can put this into a `changelog` section in this README. They want to know the line of code that was changed, as well as a brief description of what was changed. For example:
* _Line 10_: change `with` to `width`
* _Line 2_: change `too` to `to`

_Take a look at the following resources for how to create a changelog using proper Markdown Syntax._

## What is a README

A README is a document designed to inform someone about your program. This can include installation, documentation, the most recent changes, etc. Modern READMEs are written in Markdown, which allows them to be formatted using simple [syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Why Create a README

READMEs have become the standardized way of providing critical information about software to users. They allow you to document your work, give instructions and references, encourage interest, and facilitate understanding of your program.

## The Basic Structure of a README

The following is an example README structure:

- #### Title
- #### Description
- #### Installation Instructions
- #### Usage Instructions
- #### Credits
- #### License

However, it is important to keep in mind that every element in your README should provide pertinent and useful information. Some sections may not be relevant, so be sure to tailor your README to best serve the user. Your README should almost always include a title, a description, setup instructions, and contact information for issues.

## Moving Forward

Get into the habit of writing a README for every program you write. The more practice and feedback you get now the less of a headache writing READMEs will be in the future.
