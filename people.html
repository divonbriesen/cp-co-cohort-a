        </li>
        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m still super young so I don’t
          have the greatest academic background. I graduated from Garinger
          High School in 2020. During this time, I learned multiple
          instruments and introduced myself to computers.

          and Graphic Design.

          to become non-existent, so I continued to teach myself. Software is
          something that I watched change the world and has become very
          inmportant and incredibly useful in all of our lives. I would like
          to be a part of the force that continues to create software that
          will help people push their personal boudaries further by solving

        <li>
          <strong>Personal Background:</strong> Grew up in NM, then school in DC, grad school in VA, moved to Charlotte
          for work around '97. CPCC since '01. Seven kids, 4 cats, a fish, and a Gekko…
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional Background:</strong> Apart from babysitting and that sort of thing as a kid I started as
          a teen with construction and working a movie theater. Then on to a wide variety of jobs, ranging from AV setup
          to cafeteria management and computer sales. Been teaching professionally since about 2000, not including
          stints as a skiing instructor.

        <li>
          <strong>Academic background:</strong> BSLA, MS/MIS, lots of training - i mean lots. Worked in everything from
          Ski Instruction to Movie theaters, but more recently as a consultant and teacher. I do a lot of conference
          presentations and professional workshops, and teach in a couple of different places along with my full-time
          work at CPCC. Information/Technology background: Started with macs in early 90's, then on to PC's in grad
          school, and now just see 'em all as tools. I want them to do the job, and don't care about much else. I see
          computers as magnifications of possibilities.

          <strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually
          ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a
          Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 7-10 at home and work, though I just got a mac laptop to
          play with.

          <strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I donated my body to science in school to earn money -
          in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always
          wonder...
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a
          middle-aged dad.
