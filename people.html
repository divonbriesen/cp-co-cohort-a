          reach all of my goals even if it hurts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m still super young so I don’t
          have the greatest academic background. I graduated from Garinger
          High School in 2020. During this time, I learned multiple
          instruments and introduced myself to computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I have lots of

          school. The library allowed me to check out multiple books on Web
          and Graphic Design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> This new school Dell

              own outside of work. It gives me a chance to artistically
              express myself in a way I haven’t before.

          years ago. For the last 9 years I have served as Scoutmaster and
          Assistant Scoutmaster for my son’s Boy Scout troop. We spend most of
          our time exposing our kids to different activities and attending
          their track and XC meets.

          to code when I joined the “Fast Track” program at IBG solutions, a
          Charlotte based tech company. After a year in the program it seemed
          to become non-existent, so I continued to teach myself. Software is
          something that I watched change the world and has become very
          inmportant and incredibly useful in all of our lives. I would like
          to be a part of the force that continues to create software that
          will help people push their personal boudaries further by solving
          problems. I use and/or am familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
          Reactjs, Nextjs, React Native, Tailwind CSS, MUI, Git, Github,
          Bootstrap, MongoDB, SQL, and Firebase.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Background:</strong> Grew up in NM, then school in DC, grad school in VA, moved to Charlotte
          for work around '97. CPCC since '01. Seven kids, 4 cats, a fish, and a Gekko…
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional Background:</strong> Apart from babysitting and that sort of thing as a kid I started as
          a teen with construction and working a movie theater. Then on to a wide variety of jobs, ranging from AV setup
          to cafeteria management and computer sales. Been teaching professionally since about 2000, not including
          stints as a skiing instructor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Academic background:</strong> BSLA, MS/MIS, lots of training - i mean lots. Worked in everything from
          Ski Instruction to Movie theaters, but more recently as a consultant and teacher. I do a lot of conference
          presentations and professional workshops, and teach in a couple of different places along with my full-time
          work at CPCC. Information/Technology background: Started with macs in early 90's, then on to PC's in grad
          school, and now just see 'em all as tools. I want them to do the job, and don't care about much else. I see
          computers as magnifications of possibilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually
          ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a
          Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 7-10 at home and work, though I just got a mac laptop to
          play with.

          <strong>Courses I'm in & Why:</strong>

        <li>
          <strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I donated my body to science in school to earn money -
          in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always
          wonder...
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a
          middle-aged dad.
